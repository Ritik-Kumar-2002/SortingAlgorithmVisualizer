            <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
            <p> Sorting algorithms are used to sort a data structure according to a specific order relationship, such as
                numerical order or lexicographical order.</p>
            <p>This operation is one of the most important and widespread in computer science. For a long time, new
                methods have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster.</p>
            <p> There are currently hundreds of different sorting algorithms, each with its own specific
                characteristics. They are classified according to two metrics: space complexity and time complexity.</p>
            <p> Those two kinds of complexity are represented with asymptotic notations, mainly with the symbols O, Θ,
                Ω, representing respectively the upper bound, the tight bound, and the lower bound of the algorithm's
                complexity, specifying in brackets an expression in terms of n, the number of the elements of the data
                structure.
            </p>
            <p> Most of them fall into two categories:</p>
            <p> Logarithmic
                The complexity is proportional to the binary logarithm (i.e to the base 2) of n.
                An example of a logarithmic sorting algorithm is Quick sort, with space and time complexity O(n × log
                n).</p>
            <p> Quadratic
                The complexity is proportional to the square of n.
                An example of a quadratic sorting algorithm is Bubble sort, with a time complexity of O(n2).</p>
            <p> Space and time complexity can also be further subdivided into 3 different cases: best case, average case
                and worst case.</p>
            <p> Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand and it's easy to get confused. We believe visualizing
                sorting algorithms can be a great way to better understand their functioning while having fun!</p>
            <p> The bigger bubbles reach the top faster than smaller bubbles, and this algorithm works in the same way.
                It iterates through the data structure and for each cycle compares the current element with the next
                one, swapping them if they are in the wrong order.</p>
            <p> It's a simple algorithm to implement, but not much efficient: on average, quadratic sorting algorithms
                with the same time complexity such as Selection Sort or Insertion Sort perform better.</p>

            <h1> BUBBLE SORT </h1>
            <p>Bubble Sort is an iterative sorting algorithm that imitates the movement of bubbles in sparkling water.
                The bubbles represents the elements of the data structure.</p>

            <h1> SELECTION SORT </h1>
            <p>Selection Sort is an iterative and in-place sorting algorithm that divides the data structure in two
                sublists: the ordered one, and the unordered one. The algorithm loops for all the elements of the data
                structure and for every cycle picks the smallest element of the unordered sublist and adds it to the
                sorted sublist, progressively filling it.</p>
            <p>
                It's a really simple and intuitive algorithm that does not require additional memory, but it's not
                really efficient on big data structures due to its quadratic time complexity.

            <h1> QUICK SORT </h1>
            <p> Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm based on splitting the data structure in smaller partitions and sort
                them recursively until the data structure is sorted.</p>
            <p> This division in partitions is done based on an element, called pivot: all the elements bigger than the
                pivot get placed on the right side of the structure, the smaller ones to the left, creating two
                partitions. Next, this procedure gets applied recursively to the two partitions and so on.

        <div id="InsertionSort" class="textContainer">
            <h1> INSERTION SORT </h1>
            <p> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It's
                less performant than advanced sorting algorithms, but it can still have some advantages: it's really
                easy to implement and it's efficient on small data structures almost sorted.</p>
            <p> The algorithm divides the data structure in two sublists: a sorted one, and one still to sort.
                Initially, the sorted sublist is made up of just one element and it gets progressively filled. For every
                iteration, the algorithm picks an element on the unsorted sublist and inserts it at the right place in
                the sorted sublist. It's available in several variants such as Gnome Sort.
